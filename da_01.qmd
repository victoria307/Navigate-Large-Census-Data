## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this page is to provide an introduction to the data access process when starting a research project. We'll walk through key steps and tools you'll need to locate and retrieve meaningful data from public sources like the U.S. Census.

This page covers:

1.  Ô∏è An introduction to census data: what it is and why we use it\
2.  How to identify and select the *right* dataset for your research question\
3.  Common issues you might encounter---and how to troubleshoot them

### What is Census data? Why we use it

Census data are official statistics collected systematically by governments to capture demographic, economic, and social information about the population [^1].

Census data is a powerful resource for researchers for several key reasons:

1.  **Longitudinal Coverage**\
    Offers data across many years, making it ideal for studying trends over time.

2.  **Relatively Clean Format**\
    Public-use datasets are well-documented and often come pre-processed, saving time on data wrangling.

3.  **Rich, Multi-Dimensional Information**\
    Includes demographic, economic, housing, and geographic variables---useful across many research fields.

4.  **Representative Sample**\
    Designed to reflect the broader population, allowing for generalizable insights.

### Source of Census Data

Census and survey data can be accessed from a variety of sources depending on your research needs:

1.**Public Agencies**

-   **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**\
    Employment, wages, and unemployment rates from datasets such as:
    -   CPS (Current Population Survey)\
    -   QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages)\
    -   LAUS (Local Area Unemployment Statistics)
-   **Census Bureau**\
    Population, economic, housing data from:
    -   ACS (American Community Survey)\
    -   Decennial Census\
    -   SIPP (Survey of Income and Program Participation)
-   **Federal Reserve**\
    Financial and consumer data, including:
    -   FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)\
    -   SCF (Survey of Consumer Finances)

2.  **International Organizations**

-   Global development indicators and demographic data (e.g., World Bank, IMF, UN)

3.  **State Government**

-   State-level data on employment, education, health, and more

4.  **Academic Data Archives**

-   **IPUMS** -- Integrated Public Use Microdata Series for harmonized census and survey data

5.  **Direct Data Requests**

-   Custom requests through data repositories or agency contacts

### How to Identify Key Information in a Dataset

- **Geographical & Temporal Coverage**  
  National, regional, state, or local levels  
  Annual, quarterly, monthly, or one-time collection

- **Variable Definitions**  
  Understand how variables are constructed (e.g., age groups, inflation-adjusted prices)

- **Survey Design & Dataset Type**  
  Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal  
  Sample design: random, stratified, weighted
  
### Tips for selecting the right dataset 

- Identify the core variables needed for your research
- Match the dataset‚Äôs geography and time coverage to your question
- Look for unique identifiers (e.g., FIPS codes) to support merging
- Choose datasets that are easy to access and compatible with your tools

üìå When collecting data, it‚Äôs common to realize that no single dataset contains everything you need. A practical approach is to:

1. **Assess what‚Äôs possible** with the data you already have.
2. **Identify complementary datasets** that can be merged ‚Äî this is especially helpful when working with aggregate-level data.
