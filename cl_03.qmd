## 🎯 Purpose

For this file, your goal is: 
1. Filter the dataset to include only the observations relevant to your research question 
2. Clean missing values by identifying and handling incomplete or unusable entries
3. Save a final, analysis-ready dataset that’s structured and scoped for your specific study

## Further limitation

```{r}

# Load the dataset you cleaned 
data_2000_pre <- read.xlsx("data/outcome/2000_pre.xlsx")

```

Apply any sample restrictions relevant to your analysis.

For example, a common one is to exclude individuals in group quarters.

Keep only those living in households.
```{r}

  data_2000_pre <- data_2000_pre %>%
    filter(gq %in% c(1, 2, 5))
```
📌 You may have noticed that there are many variables you didn’t initially consider, but they turn out to be essential for your analysis. One example is [Group Quarters](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/GQ#codes_section) (GQ)—a detail that can significantly affect interpretation but is easy to overlook.

💭 Why might we want to set a limitation based on group quarters? Can you identify other variables that are often treated as “default” controls in empirical analysis?


## Missing value restrictions

```{r}
# Keep only individuals without missing values in the variables we need later

  data_2000_pre <- data_2000_pre %>%
    mutate(
      touse = complete.cases(select(., incwage, schooling, schooling_sp, exp, exp2, 
                                   topcoded, topcoded_uhr, perwt, ageg, race, marr, 
                                   immigrant, region, statefip, origin, wagehr, wagewk))
    ) %>%
    filter(touse)  # <- Refined version

```

## Save the final dataset for Analysis

```{r}

write.xlsx(data_2000_pre, "data/outcome/2000_final.xlsx")
```
